	addon_description=_("""freeAudio is an internet radio, podcast, audio-book, and local music add-on for NVDA that provides seamless access to thousands of internet radio stations via the Radio Browser open directory, RSS/Atom podcast feeds, the libriVox + GETEM digital library for the visually impaired, and your own local audio files and folders through its built-in jukebox. It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station, per-podcast, per-audio-book, and per-jukebox-track audio profiles. Podcast episodes, audio book chapters, and jukebox tracks resume automatically from where you left off - jukebox folders even pick up on the last track you were playing - with adjustable pitch-preserving playback speed and independent pitch-shift (semitone transpose). Playback is handled by BASS, with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, time-shift rewind of live radio, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log with lyrics lookup. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),
