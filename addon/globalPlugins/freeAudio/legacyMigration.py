"""One-time import of a previous FreeRadio installation's data into freeAudio.

freeAudio is the renamed successor of FreeRadio. Because the old add-on is
being removed from the NVDA add-on store, it can't ship a final "please
migrate" update, so the new add-on does the hand-over itself on first start:

* data files/folders in NVDA's config folder named freeradio* are COPIED to
  freeAudio* (never moved, so an old install that is still present keeps
  working until the user removes it);
* the old add-on's section in nvda.ini is read and its values are copied into
  the freeAudio section (only keys freeAudio knows about, and only if the user
  hasn't already set them in freeAudio);
* if the old default recordings folder exists and the user hadn't chosen a
  folder, freeAudio keeps using it instead of silently starting an empty one;
* if the old add-on is still installed, the user is told to remove it, since
  both would fight over the same shortcuts and audio device.

Not migrated: custom shortcuts the user assigned in NVDA's Input Gestures
dialog (NVDA stores those per add-on module path, so they don't carry over).
