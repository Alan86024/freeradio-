# FreeRadio - Small independent config toggles: mute notifications,

#
# Extracted from GlobalPlugin in __init__.py. Mixed into GlobalPlugin, so
# `self` here is a GlobalPlugin instance - self._dialog (defined elsewhere
# on GlobalPlugin) is used as a normal instance attribute via the class's
# MRO, no import needed for it.
#
# None of these scripts has a default gesture (all are bound manually via
# NVDA's Input Gestures dialog), so - unlike every other mixin extracted
# so far - nothing needs to be added to GlobalPlugin's __gestures dict.
